## Deprecations

Containers here can be **deprecated** at any point, this could be for any reason described below.

1. The upstream application is **no longer actively developed**
2. The upstream application has an **official upstream container** that follows closely to the mission statement described here
3. The upstream application has been **replaced with a better alternative**
4. The **maintenance burden** of keeping the container here **is too bothersome**

Use container images published within this repository at your own risk. These images are provided as-is and are not officially supported by the upstream application developers.
